# This is a file containing all information to draw all layouts for qtlcnc.

# All text after # is not interpreted.

# All parameters input in here in Forth like style just because it's faster and easier to parse them.

# First we have to set the geometry of the display where the program window will appear

# Define the size of logical grid where all buttons, sliders, etc will be placed.
# For simplicity and nice look I use square unit of size [ucell x ucell]

# IVAR - defines the variable with the name "ucell" and value 100.
# you can put floating point number, but it will be rounded to integer.
# usell is set in pixels.
# Variable names and commands are case sensitive. 
100 ucell IVAR  	 	

# All coordinates of elements like buttons will be done in these ligical units,
# For example, if you want to place a button to the left top corner, then the coordinates of the button will be 0,0
# for button on the right top side will be for instance 20,0. Left bottom - 0,15, and so on.

# Layout offset is set in pixels, from the top left cofner of client area of window: <x_offset> <y_offset> LOFFS

10 xoffs IVAR
15 yoffs IVAR
xoffs yoffs LOFFS

# Or you can put just : 10 15 LOFFS

# The flag "lauto" shows if program should calculate geometry from desktop parameters.
# The automatically calculated values could give not very nice result. If it set to 0, prigram gets all geometry
# from this file. If it set to 1 - ignore the geometry given here.
0 lauto IVAR

# Geometry of the window with respect to display coordinates and size of the windows
# if lauto == 1 these params are ignored and application is trying to load full screen mode.
